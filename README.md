# "Batch File" language syntax for Sublime Text

Add customized "batch file" syntax highlighting.

Modification from baseline includes changing default comment (used for comment toggling) to `:: ` from the previous `rem `.

## Installing

Installation via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) is the recommended method.

Add

	"repositories":
	[
		"https://raw.github.com/rivy/ST-channel/master/repository.json"
	],

to the Package Control User configuration file (at "Preferences / Package Settings / Package Control / Settings - User").


## Usage

Batch files (.bat, .cmd) files will have appropriate syntax highlighting and support for comment toggling.
